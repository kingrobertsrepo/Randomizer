"Expandable Sack- This mundane-looking sack is adorned with Bella's backpack logo in the front and it is said that this sack can hold more than even a bag of holding. When pulled out of Bella's bag, the sack itself appears normal and only expands to fit whatever is put into it within reason. The sack itself can hold up to 128 cubic feet of material and will not break no matter how much weight is put inside it. (Warning: The expandable sack does not decrease the weight of items put into it like the bag of holding, so don't put too much into it unless you want to try and figure out how to move a 1,000lb sack. In addition, if items are in the expandable sack when someone attempts to put it back into Bella's bag of bits and bobs, Bella is not responsible for what happens to the individual who attempts such an act.)",

The main draw to grellsvice is a tingling sensation in the muscles and extra-sensitive motor functionality. This comes with a strong euphoric rush whenever a new body part is moved. The drawback is the lack of motor functionality during the hangover and the incredibly dulled sense of touch accompanied with it.",

Unfortunately, the apprentice who enchanted them has a fondness for garish design choices. The caltrops act as normal caltrops in every way save the following: They deal 2d4 magical piercing damage to anyone who fails the save against them, and all creatures who can see make the save with advantage as the caltrops are glowing with a vibrant and dangerous light. A creature may spend their action for two turns to gather all the caltrops up - they are glowing, and thus easy to find",

"Millifer's Potion of Fear: Millifer has some very obvious ideas about what dangerous, frightening, and awesome were. When imbibing this potion you become the embodiment of Millifer’s ideal figure of terror; you grow to Large size, your voice becomes booming and eyes glow (as though affected by the Thaumaturgy cantrip) and hostile creatures within 30 feet who can see or hear you must make a Wisdom save (DC 13) or become Frightened of you for 1d4+1 turns. At the end of each turn, affected creatures may attempt to make the save again. Creatures who save against this effect are immune to the effect for 24 hours. The Fear effect ends after ten minutes, but the glowing eyes, most of the size, and the booming voice linger for a week. (While the height lowers to the high end of medium you remain extremely tall.) For that week any attempt to make social rolls not involving intimidation and any dexterity rolls involving fine motor control or balance are made at disadvantage as your new body and booming voice are unfamiliar to you. After a week you return to normal, but you may be returned to your original state prematurely by the application of a spell or Greater Restoration.",
"Magic Stepping Stones: Intended purpose: Stones float and provide stepping points in the air. Can be commanded to move one at a time to allow for distance. Actual use: Stones attach to the bottom of the wielder's feet and can only be removed by spending 1 round per stone to remove them. They are heavy enough to impede movement (halves move speed) and will cause the wielder to sink in water. They are also noisy on hard floors (DA on stealth rolls when on wood, stone, or any other solid surface.)",
"Escape Rope: Intended purpose: When the command word is spoken, the rope and anyone holding onto it are instantly transported to the entrance of the building, cave, etc. they are currently in. Actual use: When the command word is spoken, the rope instantly leaves the grasp of anyone holding it and falls to the ground. For the next 1d3 hours, the rope will magically move on its own to avoid being held or contained by any creature with an INT score of 3 or higher.",

"Dancing Sword: You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls. While the sword hovers, once per turn it will randomly swing at anything within a 5ft radius of it while dancing around and then move towards another random creature within 30ft. After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.",
"Bag of holding: As an action can be used to grapple a creature, at which point the user of the bag can release the bag and the grappled creature will remain grappled as long as the bag is attached. The grappled creature can use an action to make a DC 13 strength check to end the grapple.",

A device that when physically operated into any type of door will make it reverse its orientation of opening, if previously you would need to pull the door to open it, you now need to push it and vice versa. It achieves this by twisting the physical structure of the door on its axis, fast and in a violent way so the hinges are on the opposite side of the door arch. When installed the operator must succeed a Dex save to not get hit by the twisting door or get hit by 1d4/6 bludgeoning damage.",
"Absinthe Candle: An inventive yet stupid gnome by the name of Dankel found himself in a dark bar. In an attempt to impress his fellow bar patrons by creating a light just with what he could find around said bar, Dankel soaked a rag in absinthe, pushed it halfway into the bottle, and lit the half of the rap hanging out. It did create a fairly bright but unfortunately quite unruly flame... ultimately causing him to drop the bottle to the ground, starting an even brighter and more unruly flame! ...that eventually took the whole bar down with it... An unfortunate accident really, but it led to the invention of a rather effective weapon!",
"Gelfe's Hearty Spike: A mechanical spike that is driven directly into the user's heart. It delivers a proprietary blend of potions directly into the bloodstream through the heart giving the spiked user a heightened sense of awareness (+3 to perception checks) and it also gives the user increased anxiety and an unshakable sense that something bad is about to happen. The user is killed if the spike is removed, oh wait.",

When chewed on, it causes the user to have a pleasant, tingling sensation of the lips, tongue, and gums. As well, it can give the user a sense of mental sharpness and alertness. If swallowed, it causes nausea and vomiting if the user fails a DC 13 Constitution check. If used for 1d6 hours continuously, the user must make a DC 15 Constitution check. If failed, they experience nausea, but if passed they gain advantage on Perception checks for the next 1d4 hours.

"Deluge: Packaged in single-dose vials, ingesting this ethereal blue liquid gives subjects temporary access to spell-like abilities of varying degrees; usually cantrips and 1st Level spells, but sometimes more powerful spells depending on the purity of the substance. However, the temporary magic abilities come with a price: each time an individual ingests Deluge they take Constitution damage: 1d4 for average doses, 1d6 and above for purer doses. This is because the magical energy that Deluge is providing is actually taken from their own souls and continued use will cause them to gradually wither away. It’s named Deluge because it feels like a flood of energy and power washes over you.",

The amazing cube technically has no limits on how many spells it can hold, but every time it absorbs a spell, there is a 10% chance (+ another 10% for every spell after the first it has absorbed) that it will expel ALL of the spells it absorbed in all 6 directions it’s faces are facing. This can lead to some incredibly chaotic results, such as shooting six fireballs out of all of its faces, and then flooding the area around it with water before shooting an eldritch blast at whatever targets are on the correct angles of the cube, or charming 4 separate creatures at once while also issuing a command creature spell making all of them drop their weapons. You can reduce the odds of the cube expelling its spells to 10% if you spend half an hour and expend a spell slot with it. However, any spells it absorbs after this will still add their bonus 10% chance.",
"Henswallow's Handy-dandy Healing Handcrank: This small metal box has a hand crank with a wooden knob and is designed to be laced onto a belt.

"The Boomstick: A large club with an opening on the bottom which is filled with explosives and a trigger on the top to make them go off.
